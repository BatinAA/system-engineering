Projects for FPGA on VHDL, verilog.
### AXI-stream protocol
The AXI4-Stream protocol is used as a standard interface to connect components that wish to exchange data.
### CORDIC algorithm
It is an algorithm for math calculations in different applications. 
### High-bit searcher
That device is used to show a high bit of data input. 
### FIR filter
In signal processing, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter is a filter whose impulse response (or response to any finite length input) is of finite duration, because it settles to zero in finite time.
### IIR filter
The infinite impulse response (IIR) filter is a recursive filter in that the output from the filter is computed by using the current and previous inputs and previous outputs.
